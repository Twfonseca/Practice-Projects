### What I learned

 I improved my skills with display: grid and flex; trying to build a responsive design
 I also improved my way to plan the structure of the code thinking on how each elemente will be display in their container, box model helped to figured out about it


```html
<div class="profileBackground"> 
        <div class="profileLaier">
          <div class="photoContainer">
              <img src="style/images/image-jeremy.png" alt="Jeremy Robson photo">
          </div>
          <div class="txtContainer">
            <p>Report for</p>
            <h1>Jeremy Robson</h1>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="listContainer">
          <ul class="myList">
            <li id="daybtn">Daily</li>
            <li id="weekbtn" >Weekly</li>
            <li id="monthbtn">Monthly</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      a brief exemple of "box-model" solution: I separated each child element into a <div> so when I applied the flex display they acted independently, so it's easier to control the positions.
```
```css
    .gridContainer{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-rows: 221px 221px;
        grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr ;
        gap: 15px;
        width: 94.2%;
    }
  grid-row: 1 / span 2; About grid display I learned how to choose the column or row that the element will start and how much it will expand. I also learnd about  "fr" in grid template
```
